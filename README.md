# Subspace Community Project Registry

The home of [Subspace](https://subspace.network/) community projects. One of the [ambassador program](https://subspace.network/ambassadors) selection tasks is to produce a project that adds value to the Subspace ecosystem. Below you can find details of those projects.

If you are feeling inspired but are not part of the ambassador program (or maybe aspire to become a part of it) please do share your efforts by adding new entries to the bottom of the [community table](#community).
